Code printers
-------------
SymPy has facilities for generating code in other programming
languages. Especially in statically typed compiled languages which
offer considerable performance advantages compared to pure Python.

Current status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently the code printers in the language specific modules under
`sympy.printing` are geard towards generating inline expressions,
*e.g.*:

.. code:: python

   >>> import sympy as sp
   >>> x = sp.Symbol('x')
   >>> pw = sp.Piecewise((x, sp.Lt(x, 1), (x**2, True)
   >>> sp.ccode(pw)
   '(x < 1) ? x : pow(x, 2.0)`

this works because C has a ternary operator, however, for Fortran
earlier than Fortran 95 there is no ternary operator. The code printer
base class has a work-around implemented for this, when we give the
keyword argument ``assign_to`` the code printer can generate a
statement instead of an expression:

.. code:: python

   >>> y = sp.Symbol('y')
   >>> print(sp.fcode(pw, assign_to=y))
          if (x < 1)
              y = x
          else
              y = x**2
          end if

this in itself is not a problem, however the way it is implemented now
is that there is a special case to handle Piecewise in the printing of
`Assignment`. This approach fails when we want to print nested
statements (*e.g.* a loop with conditional exit containing an if-statement).

The module ``sympy.utilities.codegen`` currently offers the most complete
functionality to generate complete functions. Its design however does not
lend itself to easy extension through subclassing, *e.g.* the ``CodeGen.routine``
method does not use the visitor pattern, instead it handles different types
through ``if``-statements which makes it hard to use with expressions containing
user defined classes. Also the ``CCodeGen`` class hard-codes (at least in a
method which may be overloaded) what headers to include. The notion of types in
``sympy.utilities.codegen`` is also somewhat confusing (there is no easy way
to use the binary32 IEEE 754 floating point data type for example).

Proposed improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In ``sympy.codegen.ast`` there are building blocks for representing an
abstract syntax tree. This module should be extended by adding more node
types. It would allow the either the current ``codegen`` facilities to gradually
be migrated to use the ``sympy.codegen.ast`` module or (if backward incompatiblity
issues prove to be substantial) introduce a new codeprinter using these facilities.

A new module: ``sympy.codegen.algortihms``, should be created, containg common algorithms
which are often rewritten today in every new project. This module would leverage the to-be-written
classes in ``sympy.codegen.ast``. Let's consider the Newton-Rhapson method as a
case (this is working --- but unpolished --- code to convey the point):

.. code:: python

   >>> import sympy as sp
   >>> 
   ...


Finite precision arithmetics
----------------------------
Consider the following code:

.. code:: python

   >>> import sympy as sp
   >>> x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
   >>> expr = sp.exp(x) + sp.exp(y)
   >>> sp.ccode(expr)
   'exp(x) + exp(y)'

If we have *a priori* knowledge about the magnitudes of the variables we
could generate code that is more efficient and gives the same results.
Here is a mock up of what a smart code printer could do:

.. code:: python

   >>> sp.smart_ccode(expr, knowledge={sp.Gt(x + log(1e-10), y)}, precision='binary64')  # doctest: +SKIP
   'exp(x) + exp(y)'
   >>> sp.smart_ccode(expr, knowledge={sp.Gt(x + log(1e-10), y)}, precision='binary32')  # doctest: +SKIP
   'exp(x)'

above the smart code printer would use the fact that `IEEE 754 <http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/>`_ binary64
and binary32 have machine epsilon values of :math:`2^{-53}` and :math:`2^{-24}` in order
to simplify the 32-bit version not to include the ``exp(y)`` term
(which would have no effect on the finite precision expression due to
shifting).

In many algortihms (especially iteraitve ones) a computationally
cheaper approximation of an expression often works just as well but
offers an opportunity for faster convergence saving both time and
energy.

Making the code printers aware of precision would not only allow for
approximative expressions, it would also allow for more correct
results by transforming the expression into its most precision
perserving form, consider *e.g.*:

.. code:: python

   >>> sp.smart_ccode(2**x + log(x)/log(2))  # doctest: +SKIP
   'exp2(x) + log2(x)'

here the C-code printer would use the ``exp2`` and ``log2`` functions from
the C99 standard. Some transformations would only be beneficial if
the magnitude of the variables are within some span, *e.g.*: 

.. code:: python

   >>> smart_ccode((2*exp(x) - 2)*(3*exp(y) - 3), typically={x: And(-.1 < x, x < .1)})  # doctest: +SKIP
   '6*expm1(x)*(exp(y) - 1)'

here the proposed printer would use `expm1
<http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/math/expm1>`_ from the C99
standard to avoid cancellation in the subtraction.


Notes
-----
A related issue: SymPy's `cse` sometimes identifies boolean expressions, that's fine if you target `C++11` (I declare the type of the cse `const auto` and leaves type deduction to the compiler). In C it is a bit more tricky - we should eventually teach the codegen facilities about this.
